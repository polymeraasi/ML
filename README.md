# Machine learning tasks

## cnn.py:
A simple CNN model in PyTorch designed for image classification.
CNN Architecture:
- Conv2D Layer (10 filters, 3x3, stride 2, ReLU)
- MaxPooling (2x2)
- Conv2D Layer (same as first)
- MaxPooling (2x2)
- Fully Connected Layer (2 neurons, Sigmoid)

## char_rnn.py:
A simple character-level RNN (recurrent neural network) using PyTorch. The model learns to generate text
based on a given input sequence by predicting the next character.
